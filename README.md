# testExample_StringsManipulations
This is a code that was in one of the tests that I failed because couldn't make it fast enough.
Essentially, there are two strings.
First is any random string like "Dinosaur";
Second is a string that contains only 0 and 1;
This program should compare the strings and find out how many matches there are between these strings, provided that vowels are 1 and rest of the letters are 0
